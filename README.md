# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Automotive analysis using R Studio.

## Overview
For this analysis we used R studio to perform linear regression to predict MPG, statistical analysis to determine if suspension coil PSI meets design specifications.  finally we perform t-tests to determine how suspension coil lots compare statistically to the population mean value.  

## Analysis

### Linear regresion to predict MPG

*  Average temperature was 3.9 degrees higher in June than in December.
*  Max temperature for June was 85 degrees, while in December it was 83 degrees.
*  Min temperature in June was 64 degrees in June, vs. 56 degrees in December.
*  Overall, the temperatures were in a comfortable range for customers to patronize the shop.
